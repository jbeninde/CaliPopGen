# CaliPopGen

CaliPopGen is a publlished database containing population genetic data for native and naturalized eukaryotic species in California, USA (link). It summarizes the
published literature (1985 â€“ 2020) for 5,453 unique populations with genetic data from more than 187,394 individuals and 448 species
(513 including subspecies) across molecular markers including allozymes, RFLPs, microsatellites, mtDNA, and nDNA. Terrestrial
habitats accounted for the majority (46.4%) of the genetic data. Taxonomic groups with the greatest representation were Magnoliophyta (20.3%), Insecta (13.4%), and Actinopterygii
(12.9%). CaliPopGen also makes available life-history data for most included species to
enable analyses of the drivers of genetic diversity across the state. The large number of populations and wide taxonomic breadth will
facilitate explorations of ecological patterns and processes across the varied geography of California. CaliPopGen covers all terrestrial
and marine ecoregions of California and has a greater density of species and georeferenced populations than any previously published
population genetic database, and is uniquely suited to inform conservation management at the regional and state levels across taxonomic
groups.
The information shared here is the code used to generate the figures that describe the dataset in the first publication in 2022 (SciData: link).
